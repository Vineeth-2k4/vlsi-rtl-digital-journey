# VLSI RTL Digital Journey

This repository contains a structured journey through Digital Logic & RTL Design.

## Day 1: Structural Gates
- Directory: `day01_structural_gates/`
- Write and simulate AND, OR, XOR, NOT gates.
- Testbench provided. View waveforms with GTKWave.

## Day 2: Behavioural Gates 
- Directory: day02_behavioral_gates/
- Write and simulate AND, OR, XOR, NOT gates using behavioral modeling (always @(*)).
- Implement a 2:1 multiplexer using ternary operator (? :).
- Unified testbench for all modules.
- View simulation waveforms with GTKWave.
- Notes and waveform screenshot available in docs/day02_notes.md.
## Usage
1. Follow the install guide in `tools/`.
2. Navigate to `day01_structural_gates/`.
3. Run the provided simulation commands.
4. Add your notes in `docs/day01_notes.md`.
